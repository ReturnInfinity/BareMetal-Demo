/*
  Simple realtime 3D software rasterization renderer. It is fast, focused on
  resource-limited computers, located in a single C header file, with no
  dependencies, using only 32bit integer arithmetics.

  Before including the library, define S3L_PIXEL_FUNCTION to the name of the
  function you'll be using to draw single pixels (this function will be called
  by the library to render the frames). Also either init S3L_resolutionX and
  S3L_resolutionY or define S3L_RESOLUTION_X and S3L_RESOLUTION_Y.

  You'll also need to decide what rendering strategy and other settings you
  want to use, depending on your specific usecase. You may want to use a
  z-buffer (full or reduced, S3L_Z_BUFFER), sorted-drawing (S3L_SORT), or even
  none of these. See the description of the options in this file.

  The rendering itself is done with S3L_drawScene, usually preceded by
  S3L_newFrame (for clearing zBuffer etc.).

  The library is meant to be used in not so huge programs that use single
  translation unit and so includes both declarations and implementation at once.
  If you for some reason use multiple translation units (which include the
  library), you'll have to handle this yourself (e.g. create a wrapper, manually
  split the library into .c and .h etc.).

  CONVENTIONS:

  This library should never draw pixels outside the specified screen
  boundaries, so you don't have to check this (that would cost CPU time)!

  You can safely assume that triangles are rasterized one by one and from top
  down, left to right (so you can utilize e.g. various caches), and if sorting
  is disabled the order of rasterization will be that specified in the scene
  structure and model arrays (of course, some triangles and models may be
  skipped due to culling etc.).

  Angles are in S3L_Units, a full angle (2 pi) is S3L_FRACTIONS_PER_UNITs.

  We use row vectors.

  In 3D space, a left-handed coord. system is used. One spatial unit is split
  into S3L_FRACTIONS_PER_UNITs fractions (fixed point arithmetic).

     y ^
       |   _
       |   /| z
       |  /
       | /
  [0,0,0]-------> x

  Untransformed camera is placed at [0,0,0], looking forward along +z axis. The
  projection plane is centered at [0,0,0], stretrinch from
  -S3L_FRACTIONS_PER_UNIT to S3L_FRACTIONS_PER_UNIT horizontally (x),
  vertical size (y) depends on the aspect ratio (S3L_RESOLUTION_X and
  S3L_RESOLUTION_Y). Camera FOV is defined by focal length in S3L_Units.

  Rotations use Euler angles and are generally in the extrinsic Euler angles in
  ZXY order (by Z, then by X, then by Y). Positive rotation about an axis
  rotates CW (clock-wise) when looking in the direction of the axis.

  Coordinates of pixels on the screen start at the top left, from [0,0].

  There is NO subpixel accuracy (screen coordinates are only integer).

  Triangle rasterization rules are these (mostly same as OpenGL, D3D etc.):

  - Let's define:
    - left side:
      - not exactly horizontal, and on the left side of triangle
      - exactly horizontal and above the topmost
      (in other words: its normal points at least a little to the left or
       completely up)
    - right side: not left side
  - Pixel centers are at integer coordinates and triangle for drawing are
    specified with integer coordinates of pixel centers.
  - A pixel is rasterized:
    - if its center is inside the triangle OR
    - if its center is exactly on the triangle side which is left and at the
      same time is not on the side that's right (case of a triangle that's on
      a single line) OR
    - if its center is exactly on the triangle corner of sides neither of which
      is right.

  These rules imply among others:

  - Adjacent triangles don't have any overlapping pixels, nor gaps between.
  - Triangles of points that lie on a single line are NOT rasterized.
  - A single "long" triangle CAN be rasterized as isolated islands of pixels.
  - Transforming (e.g. mirroring, rotating by 90 degrees etc.) a result of
    rasterizing triangle A is NOT generally equal to applying the same
    transformation to triangle A first and then rasterizing it. Even the number
    of rasterized pixels is usually different.
  - If specifying a triangle with integer coordinates (which we are), then:
    - The bottom-most corner (or side) of a triangle is never rasterized
      (because it is connected to a right side).
    - The top-most corner can only be rasterized on completely horizontal side
      (otherwise it is connected to a right side).
    - Vertically middle corner is rasterized if and only if it is on the left
      of the triangle and at the same time is also not the bottom-most corner.

  S3L_FAST_LERP_QUALITY) to increase precision. The step is being added to the

       side of it, according to the pixel CENTERS, INCLUDING the pixel
       centers

     The principle is this:

     - Move vertically by pixels and accumulate the error (abs(dx/dy)).
     - If the error is greater than one (crossed the next pixel center), keep
       moving horizontally and substracting 1 from the error until it is less
       than 1 again.
     - To make this INTEGER ONLY, scale the case so that distance between
       pixels is equal to dy (instead of 1). This way the error becomes
       dx/dy * dy == dx, and we're comparing the error to (and potentially
